# DHBW iOS Client

###Run

DHBW-iOS uses Cocoapods in order to create a dependency management for third-party libraries. To run the application from your Xcode Installation make sure to install cocoapods first via:
```sh
$  sudo gem install cocoapods
```

Then change to the project's base directoy, where the *Podfile* lies and run:
```sh
$  pod install
```

After that you should open the *.xcworkspace* file and not the *.xcodeproj*. This is important when working with cocoapods, in order to ensure that all third-party libraries are setup to run the project.
